**Designing topology and implementing routing algorithm of wireless Network**

**Aim of the Project**:
- The primary aim of this project is to develop a tool that generates
random graphs representing UDGs based on user-defined
parameters, such as the number of nodes and area size. By
leveraging these graphs, the project aims to achieve the following
objectives
